# NLP_Question_Answering_Project
## Question Answering with the Transformer model BERT &amp; T5 models
Question Answering is an important task in NLP, since the rise of transformer models, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become useful in many fields, 
such as machine translation, sentimental analysis, chatbots etc. This project focus on Question Answering a subset of the T5 & BERT model. 
This project work through using a pretrained model for Question answering and also fine - tuning another model to achieve better answers for the context given. 
We are also careful with resource constraint we would finetune a specific aspect of the BERT(a general purpose model). 
We would provide a question & context to the model, the model would return an answer.
